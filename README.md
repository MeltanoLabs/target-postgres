#### Note on generating fake data

If you need access to the `faker` instance in your stream map expressions, you will need to install it as an additional dependency in your plugin.

If you're using [Meltano](https://docs.meltano.com/), you can add the `faker` extra to your `meltano.yml` as follows:

1. If you're installing the plugin from PyPI:

  ```yaml
  pip_url: "meltanolabs-target-postgres[faker]==<version>"
  ```

2. If you're installing the plugin from the Git repository:

  ```yaml
  # Note the nested quotes
  pip_url: "'meltanolabs-target-postgres[faker] @ git+https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/target-postgres.git@<ref>'"
  ```

## Installation

### Using [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx/)

```bash
pipx install meltanolabs-target-postgres
```

### Using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
uv tool install meltanolabs-target-postgres
```

## Configuration

### An Explanation of Various SSL Configuration Options

There are two distinct processes which both fall under the banner of SSL. One process occurs when the client wishes to ensure the identity of the server, and is the more common reason that SSL is used. Another is when the server wishes to ensure the identity of the client, for authentication/authorization purposes.

If your server is set up with a certificate and private key, and you wish to check their certificate against a root certificate which you posess, use `ssl_enable`. You may then further customize this process using the `ssl_certificate_authority` and `ssl_mode` settings. See the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBQ-SSL-CERTIFICATES) for further details.

If your server is set up with a root certificate, and you wish to provide a certificate to the server to verify your identity, use `ssl_client_certificate_enable`. You may then further customize this process using the `ssl_client_certificate` and `ssl_client_private_key` settings. See the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-CLIENTCERT) for further details.

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer target will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Source Authentication and Authorization

The database account provided must have access to:
1. Create schemas
1. Create tables (DDL)
1. Push Data to tables (DML)

## Usage

You can easily run `target-postgres` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Target Directly

```bash
target-postgres --version
target-postgres --help
# Test using the "Carbon Intensity" sample:
pipx install git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-carbon-intensity
tap-carbon-intensity | target-postgres --config /path/to/target-postgres-config.json
```

### Using Docker Compose

`docker-compose.yml` provides the commands to create two empty sample databases using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). These can be a starting point to create your own database running in Docker, or can be used to run the tap's [built-in tests](#create-and-run-tests).

## Developer Resources

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Setting Up SSL Files

We have set the provided keys in the .ssl directory to be valid for multiple centuries. However, we have also provided configuration instructions below to create all of the necessary files for testing SSL.

A list of each file and its purpose:
1. `ca.crt`: CA for client's certificate (stored on the server)
1. `cert.crt`: Client's certificate (stored on the client)
1. `pkey.key`: Client's private key (stored on the client)
1. `public_pkey.key`: Client's private key with incorrect file permissions (stored on the client)
1. `root.crt`: CA for server's certificate (stored on the client)
1. `server.crt`: Server's certificate (stored on the server)
1. `server.key`: Server's private key (stored on the server)

Run the following command to generate all relevant SSL files, with certificates valid for two centuries (73048 days).

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -days 73048 -nodes -out ssl/server.crt -keyout ssl/server.key -subj "/CN=localhost" &&
openssl req -new -x509 -days 73048 -nodes -out ssl/cert.crt -keyout ssl/pkey.key -subj "/CN=postgres" &&
cp ssl/server.crt ssl/root.crt &&
cp ssl/cert.crt ssl/ca.crt &&
cp ssl/pkey.key ssl/public_pkey.key &&
chown 999:999 ssl/server.key &&
chmod 600 ssl/server.key &&
chmod 600 ssl/pkey.key &&
chmod 644 ssl/public_pkey.key
```

Now that all of the SSL files have been set up, you're ready to set up tests with pytest.

### Create and Run Tests

Start the test databases using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Create tests within the `target_postgres/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `target-postgres` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run target-postgres --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://meltano.com/)

_**Note:** This target will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke target-postgres --version
```

See the [dev guide](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/dev_guide.html) for more instructions on how to use the Meltano SDK to
develop your own Singer taps and targets.

Note that while object types are mapped directly to jsonb, array types are mapped to a jsonb array.

If a column has multiple jsonschema types, the following order is using to order Postgres types, from highest priority to lowest priority.
- BYTEA
- ARRAY(JSONB)
- JSONB
- TEXT
- TIMESTAMP
- DATETIME
- DATE
- TIME
- DECIMAL
- BIGINT
- INTEGER
- BOOLEAN
- NOTYPE

## Content Encoding Support

Json Schema supports the [`contentEncoding` keyword](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-8), which can be used to specify the encoding of input string types.

This target can detect content encoding clues in the schema to determine how to store the data in the postgres in a more efficient way.

Content encoding interpretation is disabled by default. This is because the default config is meant to be as permissive as possible, and do not make any assumptions about the data that could lead to data loss.

However if you know your data respects the advertised content encoding way, you can enable this feature to get better performance and storage efficiency.

To enable it, set the `interpret_content_encoding` option to `True`.

### base16

The string is encoded using the base16 encoding, as defined in [RFC 4648](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-00#rfc.section.8.3
).

Example schema:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "my_hex": {
      "type": "string",
      "contentEncoding": "base16"
    }
  }
}
```

Data will be stored as a `bytea` in the database.

Example data:
```json
# valid data
{ "my_hex": "01AF" }
{ "my_hex": "01af" }
{ "my_hex": "1af" }
{ "my_hex": "0x1234" }

# invalid data
{ "my_hex": " 0x1234 " }
{ "my_hex": "House" }
```

For convenience, data prefixed with `0x` or containing an odd number of characters is supported although it's not part of the standard.
